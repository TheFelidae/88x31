# 88x31 Badges

A collection of 88x31 badges for use in... Whatever you want to use them for!

- Software tagging!
- Website linking!
- Profile decoration!
- Whatever you want!

88x31 badges are a classic form of web decoration, harkening back to the days of '95. They're a great way to add a little flair to your project, and they're a fun way to show off your affiliations, interests, skills... And so on!

In order to appear as authentic as possible, these badges are designed with the following limitations:

- 256-color palette, used by Windows 95
- Indexed color mode
- 88x31 resolution

These badges may contain customization options within the provided Aseprite files. Feel free to modify them to your heart's content!
