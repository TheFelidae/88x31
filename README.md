# 88x31 Badges

A collection of 88x31 badges for use in... Whatever you want to use them for!

- Software tagging!
- Website linking!
- Profile decoration!
- Whatever you want!

88x31 badges are a classic form of web decoration, harkening back to the days of '95. They're a great way to add a little flair to your project, and they're a fun way to show off your affiliations, interests, skills... And so on!

In order to appear as authentic as possible, these badges are designed with the following limitations:

- 256-color palette, used by Windows 95
- Indexed color mode
- 88x31 resolution

These badges may contain customization options within the provided Aseprite files. Feel free to modify them to your heart's content!

## Usage

To use these badges, simply find the one you want to use, copy its URL, and use it in any of these manners:

- Markdown

> ```markdown
> [![Badge](<My Badge URL>)](
>

- HTML

> ```html
>   <!-- You can optionally enclose it in an <a> tag to add a hyperlink -->
>   <img src="<My Badge URL>" alt="Badge">
> ```

## Contributing
