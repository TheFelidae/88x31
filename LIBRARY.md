I'm not entirely satisfied with some of the badges, so I might update them in the future.
If you have any suggestions for new badges, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
Also, I'm still learning and am not a professional artists - so please be patient with me.
If you know how to improve the badges, or skills I need to learn, please let me know!
